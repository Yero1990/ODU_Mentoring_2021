% DO NOT TOUCH!!! This line is required to prevent erroneous bibliography
% entries, where the name of the author gets replaced by a ----- line. This
% has been observed in IEEE formatting, but this is how to fix it.
% See: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/29381/is-it-normal-for-bibtex-to-replace-similar-author-names-with
@IEEEtranBSTCTL{IEEEexample:BSTcontrol,
  CTLdash_repeated_names = "no"
}  

% General template formats for different references (you can also search online for latex reference types)
% See https://www.bibtex.com/e/entry-types/

% To cite a biliographic entry in this file (references.bib),
% make sure that this file is included in the main_file.tex file you compile
% (where main_file.tex is replaced with whichever name you used)
% >>  \bibliography{references}
% >>  \bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}  %this line sets the bibliography style


% Each time a new bibliography entry is added to this file, and/or a reference is cites in the document (\cite{ref_key}, do the following:
% 1. pdflatex main_file.tex   (this updates the corresponding main_file.aux file with the new bib entry)
% 2. bibtex main_file.aux     (run bibtex on the auxilary file: bibtex is a reference management software)
%                              this command also creates a .bbl file, with ONLY the cited references sorted either alphabetically or by citation
% 3. pdflatex main_file.tex   (run this command two times, the reason is explained in reference:
